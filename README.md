# impact-of-Loss-Functions-on-3D-BRaTS-segmentation
The project implements a 3D U-Net model with various loss functions to segment brain tumors into four classes: background, necrotic core, edema, and enhancing tumor. The code includes data preprocessing, a custom data generator, model training, and evaluation with ensemble methods for combining predictions.
